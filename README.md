# TODO

**Has been made a million time, this is a personnal representation of one of the most made type of piece of software** 

Just another todo-list, in cli only, writing some big fat files in fat folders.
Use GDrive, DropBox, BitSync or whatever to sync across your devices.

The watch system could be simpler, it could use etcd for example as a backend storage, but i want it to be as portable as possible, PR are welcome.
